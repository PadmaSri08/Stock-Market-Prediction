Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is specifically designed to handle sequential data, such as time series, speech, and text. LSTM networks are capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, which makes them well suited for tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.A traditional RNN has a single hidden state that is passed through time, which can make it difficult for the network to learn long-term dependencies. LSTMs address this problem by introducing a memory cell, which is a container that can hold information for an extended period of time. The memory cell is controlled by three gates: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. These gates decide what information to add to, remove from, and output from the memory cell.
